=head1 NAME

twitter-oauth-client - OAuth-based Twitter command line client

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  ./twitter 'I can haz OAuth from the command line. #icanhazoauth'

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A OAuth-based Twitter command line client.
There's many like it, and this is mine.

Nothing special about it, really, but I hope to
transpose it to Perl 6 soon.

Twitter is dropping support for basic auth,
so start using OAuth, now!

Put it in your C<~/bin> folder and alias it to C<tw>
or something.
